# Periodic table

__[Interactive periodic table](https://pse-info.de)__ with atomic, chemical and physical properties of all known elements. Element lists, scales and much more, free and __open source__.

## Roadmap

The project consists of several phases, which will gradually add more functions to [pse-info.de](https://pse-info.de). These will include the nuclide map, calculation tools and much more. It is also planned to implement an interactive periodic table.

### âœ… Code rework of pse-info.de (``v 2.0``)

Whole rework of data and source code for the pse-info.de project. New features, extended content, support for multiple languages, light and dark theme and much more.

### ðŸ”² Chemical compounds (``v 2.1``)

Database upgrade to include (well-known) chemical compounds from organic and inorganic chemistry including properties, images and more.

### ðŸ”² Nuclides table (``v 2.2``)

Integration of the more than 3,000 known nuclides incl. interactive nuclide table, important information, decay chains, etc.

### ðŸ”² Tools and calculators (``v 2.3``)

Phase three provides the periodic table with a variety of important tools for calculations based on existing data, such as the molar mass of certain formulas, the radioactivity of nuclides, and many other things.

## Database

The PSE project is __open source__. This also applies to the data used on this website. These are provided under the __MIT license__ and can be downloaded as needed.

The data provided on this website do not claim to be correct, complete and up-to-date. They come from reference books, Wikipedia, WebElements and other websites. Pse-info.de assumes no liability for the use of this data and points out to use further sources if necessary.

Like this website, its data can also be used freely. Feel free to use it to start your own project, perform further data analysis or similar. A reference to [pse-info.de](https://pse-info.de) and the [developer](https://komed3.de) is not necessary, but it would be friendly and would help to increase the reach of the project.
